# WorkNet Frontend
Worknet is a web application which allows users to access a comprehensive database of job listings, seamlessly connect with potential employers and manage their job search journey with ease. The app is currently a work in progress as we continue to implement additional functionalities, ranging from image integration to the introduction of entirely new features. Stay tuned for exciting updates!

## Features
